Meet your essential tool for document editing. This software simplifies managing and arranging your projects, even when dealing with numerous files from different origins. It supports multiple formats and offers convenient features like:

1. Managing page order and numbers through thumbnail right-clicks

2. Inserting digital signatures, modifying links, or adding comments to files

3. Handling documents with non-standard page numbering, including Roman or Arabic numerals

Additionally, the Adobe Scan mobile app enables scanning and editing directly from your device. You can also retrieve documents on your computer using cloud services such as Document Cloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
Subscribing to Creative Cloud gives you access to a powerful PDF editor and reader. With this, you can modify, annotate, and convert PDFs to Word (.doc), Excel (.xlsx), and other common file types.

Acrobat Pro DC also lets you edit and search scanned documents, insert images or media, and compare two PDFs side by side—making it ideal for converting printed materials into digital formats.

## Main Functions: Edit and Manage
Users appreciate Acrobat’s standard editing tools, which include splitting or merging PDFs, adjusting visual styles, adding or deleting text, and more. It can also reduce PDF file size without losing content, though results may vary based on the original document.

You can design editable forms, allowing others to easily add signatures, dates, printed names, and similar details. This is especially useful for handling waivers or contracts.

## Windows Integration
Acrobat Pro DC offers an intuitive workspace that defaults to the Home view when no PDF is open. Recent files are readily available, drawn from recently sent items, local Adobe Document Cloud storage, or recent file-sharing apps.

The All Tools panel serves as your command center, offering options like Create & Edit or Protect & Standardize in one convenient location. You can create shortcuts for frequently used tools and use the right panel for quick access to editing options, thumbnails, comments, and other markers—keeping everything you need within easy reach.
